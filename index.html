                    <li> I believe that people are born smart or dumb and can never change.</li>

                    <li> I take constructive feedback as personal criticism.</li>

                        succeed the next time.</li>
                    <li>I can always become better if I try, it depends on my effort.</li>
                    <li>I think that every opportunity is a chance to grow my knowledge, I can always learn something new.</li>
                    <li>Most importantly: I never say, "I can't."</li>
